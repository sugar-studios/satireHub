            class and setting their display to "block" (was normally display:none). The searchArticles() function filters articles based on the user's input in a
            search bar by comparing each article's title (using a data attribute) to the search term; matching articles are displayed, while non-matching articles are
            gradually hidden. The clearSearch() function clears the search bar and re-runs the search to restore all articles. This ensures a responsive and dynamic
            search experience for a list of articles.
        
            Although after asking chat gpt what time complexity this script is it spat out that it is somthing like O(n*m) which is pretty bad

            An article should make sense on its own and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the site." 
            And techincally each of these articles is it's webpage... but not really next comment will explain-->

            <!--I spent waaaaayyyy too long trying to get this to work, what I did intially is make a page for each new entry, which was easy but felt like 
            that would massively inflate file size comapred to a JSON. So I tried to dynamically parse a JSON file based off the url paramters and that 
            did not work. I don't know why but the JSON kept throwing errors so I gave up and just embedded the JSON directly into the JS. I assume that is 
            bad practice because you are supposed to sepreate data layers but I do not care at this point.
